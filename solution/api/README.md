# Serverless SaaS With Fauna and Algolia

## Setup

### AWS Named Profile
* Navigate to the IAM services dashboard and create a new user with Administrator access (to provision
  AWS resources).
* Create an "access key" and when done copy its **Access Key** and **Secret Access Key** for the next step, below.
* Create a "named profile" in your AWS CLI's credentials file:
  * Your AWS **config** and **credentials** files are normally in the **~/.aws** folder (Linux/macOS) 
    or **C:&#92;Users&#92; USERNAME &#92;.aws&#92;** (Windows). If you've installed the AWS CLI, 
    you should see them there. For more information about config and credentials file settings see 
    [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-configure-files-using-profiles)
  * Edit the `credentials` file by adding the following entry: 
  ```
  [serverless-workshop]
  aws_access_key_id=<<"Access Key" from the previous step>>
  aws_secret_access_key=<<"Secret Access Key" from the previous step>>
  ```

### Serverless Setup

Rename the `.env.json.example` file to `.env.json`
```json

    "ENVIRONMENT": "soln",
    "FAUNA_API_KEY": "<secret>",

    "ALGOLIA_SEARCH_ONLY_KEY": "<search_only_key>",
    "JWKS_URI": "<Auth0_json_web_key_set>"
}
```
...and edit in the variable values with the following:
